Math::Units did <em>almost</em> what I wanted.  I really wanted something like Math::Calc::Units -- which felt unfinished, and
hadn't been updated for years.  This (<a href="<TMPL_VAR NAME=DIST>"><TMPL_VAR NAME=DIST></a>) is something I wrote for dividing things like "6,500 ft" and "43 s" and
getting "103.16 miles/hour".  This module uses Math::Units and Math::Algebra::Symbols to do all it's magic.  Really, PhysicalValue
is just a collection of clever operator overloads.
Check out the man page: <a href="<TMPL_VAR NAME=Math-Units-PhysicalValue.pod>">Math::Units::PhysicalValue module</a>.
