AUTHOR'S NOTE 

    I was unhappy with the unfinished Math::Calc::Units; but I was
    happy with Math::Units.  I felt that there should be a perl
    module that handles units in a human readable way.

    And this is it.  Perhaps.  I imagine I'm an unlikely choice to
    author a module like this.  Then again, nobody else did it.

SYNOPSIS

    use Math::Units::PhysicalValue qw(PV);

    my $exit  = PV "10,000 ft";
    my $open  = "3500 ft";
    my $delay = "43 s";

    my $dist  = $exit - $open;
    my $rate  = $dist / $delay;

    my $weight = "180 lbs";
    my $momentum = ($weight * ( ($exit - $open) / $delay )) + "0 kg*m/s";

    print "$momentum\n";                     # prints 3,761.82 kg*m/s
    print ($rate + "0 miles/hour"), "\n"     # prints 103.07 miles/hour
